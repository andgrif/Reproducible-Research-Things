### Encrypt your computer
* Encryption- https://www.griffith.edu.au/about-griffith/cybersecurity/data-protection
* Win 10 Encryption: https://www.windowscentral.com/how-use-bitlocker-encryption-windows-10
* Win 7 Encryption: https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/details.aspx?id=4794 (Call 55555 first and ask their advice as they can help you install this- it doesn't look as simple as Win 10)
* Mac OS https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT204837

---
Using Multi-Factor Authentication when the option is available (Signing in with a password and an email to your account with a pin)

Avoid unsecure wifi - If its available, Eduroam is usually a better option than free wifi/cafe wifi

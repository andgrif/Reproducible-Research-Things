### Step 4
## Automation
---
## Can you automate any repetitive tasks? 
---
Repetitious processes are susceptible to error when performed manually. The risk of human error is reduced by automating as much of a process as possible. Tools such as formulas and macros in Excel, and coding for data engineering tasks such as data mining and data wrangling not only make processes faster, but they do not become distracted while performing a sequence of tasks and accidently introduce an error.

### Beginner
Let's thing about the repetitive tasks that you could automate- do you always rename files the same way? Do you manually copy files across?
---
### Advanced
Could you code up your work so its completely automated? 
---
Ways you can automate things:
* Spreadsheet Macros and formulas
* MacOS: Automator
* Win 10: Task scheduler
* Microsoft Power Automate or Google App Script
* Learning to code in Python or R - *Talk to your local hacky hour or Software Carpentry people

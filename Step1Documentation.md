### Step 1

### Documentation

---
Documentation is the idea of documenting your procedures for your experiment so that an outsider could understand the workings of your lab. 
---
This can include where your results and working data are saved. Copy your lab notebook if you have one onto a digital format and save it to a safe place (such as research storage). 

Make sure these are saved somewhere that's accessible to your supervisor/team. 

Note: 
Highlight that it can be as simple as a word document on research space or taking photos of your lab notebook and uploading them into a folder. 
---

Have you got a new staff member coming onboard to your team? They are a prime candidate to collate information and document as it will help them become familiar to the team and learn how the lab/team works.
---
## Bus Factor

Note:
Ideally you want to document anything that a lab member coming on board would need to know. Documentation is all about changing your Bus Factor - how many people on a project would need to be hit by a bus to make a project fail. Many times, projects can have a bus factor of one. Adding documentation means when someone goes on leave, needs to take leave suddenly or finishes their study, their work is preserved for your lab.

---
### Documentation will also be important for any audits in your lab or if someone would like to reproduce your research.

## How?
---
### Beginner 
* Read this first: [How to start Documenting and more by CESSDA ERIC](https://www.cessda.eu/Training/Training-Resources/Library/Data-Management-Expert-Guide/2.-Organise-Document/Documentation-and-metadata)<br/><br/>Start with documenting in a text file or document- any start is a good start<br/> Have this document automatically synced to the cloud with your data or keep this in a shared place such as Google docs, Microsoft teams or Owncloud
---
### Intermediate
* Once you have the basics in place, go into detail on how your workflow goes from your raw data to the finished results. This can be anything from a downloaded function list from SPSS/Virtual Lab to the code used to create it. 
---
### Advanced
* Now that you've got a good head start, time to learn about Git Repositories and wikis.  
---
### Internal Resources
* Wiki options at Griffith
* Wiki or using the documents in Teams
* [Research Space](https://research-storage.griffith.edu.au/)
* Griffith's Gitlab wiki options - talk to eResearch Support or Hacky Hour
